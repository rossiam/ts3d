== Overview

I love using OpenSCAD but I really miss the power of a full programming language. (I particularly
miss data structures.) So, I've written this little TypeScript library that generates OpenSCAD
files.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This project is a work in progress.
====

== My Workflow

* create a TypeScript file that creates a shape and renders it

.Example Script
[source,typescript]
----
// TODO: add imports from jsr

const randomThing = difference(
	union(
		cuboid(100, 50, 25).round({ edges: 'all', radius: 4 }).move(0, -100, 0),
		cylinder(10, 50).chamfer({ radius: 4, edges: 'bottom' }).move(4, 4, 0),
	),
	cuboid(32, 16, 42).round({ radius: 4, edges: 'sides' }).move(20, 100, -1),
)

const variables = {
	'$fn': 60,
	chamfer_radius: 0.6,
}
randomThing.writeCADAndRender({ filename: 'my-awesome-model.scad', variables })
----

* run `deno` in watch mode

[source,shell]
----
$ deno run --allow-write --allow-run --watch my-awesome-model.ts
----

** `--allow-write` is needed if rendering to .scad with `writeCAD`
** `--allow-run` is needed in addition to `--allow-write` if automatically rendering to stl with
   `writeCADAndRender`

* make changes;

== Prerequisites

* https://deno.com
* https://openscad.org

== TODO

* 2d shapes: circle, square, polygon, import, projection
* 3d shapes: sphere, finish cube and cylinder, polyhedron, import, linear_extrude, rotate_extrude,
  surface
* make examples use published version
* TODOs all over the code
* TESTS TESTS TESTS

== Translating OpenSCAD to ts3d

TODO: much more to explain here

* cube
	** normally use `cuboid` (for cuboid with sides of varying links)
    ** use `cube` for actual cube
* cylinder
    ** `cylinder` is reserved for a cylinder with ends of the same diameter
	** use `frustum` for a frustum with different size circles on each end
	** use `cone` for a cone

== Candy

TODO: describe these more fully

* `.chamfer` and `round`
* `.move`
* `text3d`

== Notes

* null or undefined values in most things that take a list of shapes like union or difference
    are ignored TODO: describe why this is useful
* some idiosyncrasies of OpenSCAD have been removed; some have not
* some of my own idiosyncrasies have certainly found their way in üòÇ

== Pros and Cons

Pros

* full power of TypeScript
* full power of TypeScript (main reason for doing this; counts as _at least_ two pros üòÅ)
* some idiosyncrasies of OpenSCAD have been fixed
* can have STL files generated automatically on save

Cons

* need to check for errors in two places (mitigated somewhat by extra error checking in TypeScript)
* potentially slower but not noticeable to me
* in OpenSCAD, you can more easily include logic inside modules; in TypeScript you have
    to do the logic up front or use an https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE[
		Immediately Invoked Function Expression] TODO: add example of this
* some idiosyncrasies of OpenSCAD have been fixed (might be confusing especially since there isn't
  great documentation for this library yet)
* has its own set of idiosyncrasies
